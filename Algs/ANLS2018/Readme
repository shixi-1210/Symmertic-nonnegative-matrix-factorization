This package contains the source files for generating Figure 4 a(1)-a(2) in the following paper

Z. Zhu, X. Li, K. Liu, Q. Li, ‘‘Dropping Symmetry for Fast Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization,’’ in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), December 2018. 

In order to generate Figure 4 a(a)-a(2), run Demo_image_clustering.m’, Before running, please download ‘dist2.m’ and ‘scale_dist3_knn.m’ from https://github.com/andybaoxv/symnmf, and ‘nnlsm_blockpivot.m’ from https://github.com/kimjingu/nonnegfac-matlab/blob/master/nnlsm_blockpivot.m. The codes for SymANLS and SymHALS are already included.

Disclaimer: our code ‘HALS_sparse.m’ is based on the prototype downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/eo7vwoz593ytyis/Acc_MU_HALS_PG.zip?dl=0. 

The database ORL in this package is downloaded from https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html. For different database, tuning the parameter lambda may lead to better performance.
